# Warhawk Reborn has been superseded by PlayStation Network Online Emulated.
This brings back the original online mode with ranks, medals, password protected rooms and clans.
Since that method does not require any app anymore this repository is now obsolete.
See [the announcement](https://www.psone.online/game/warhawk/reborn-shutdown) for more information.
